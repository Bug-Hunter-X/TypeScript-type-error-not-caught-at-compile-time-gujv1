This code demonstrates a scenario where a type error in TypeScript is not caught during compilation. The function 'add' is defined to accept two numbers and return their sum. However, the code calls 'add' with a string and a number, which should result in a type error.  This error, however, is not caught during compilation, leading to runtime issues.  The solution involves stricter type checking and handling of potential errors.
